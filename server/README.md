# Cafe Tracker &middot;
> A simple coffee shop CRUD template.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CCerrer/Cafe-Tracker
cd Cafe-Tracker/server
npm run createEnv
```
This will get a template of .sample-env and create a .env file
You need to change MONGO_USER, MONGO_PASSWORD and MONGO_CLUSTER with your respectives mongodb connection.

```shell
npm run server
```
When you run this script the server will be created and the http link will be displayed on terminal.
You'll get redirected to graphql playground.

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)
Koa, GraphQL, MongoDB

In the future: React

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### For the future

I'm currently developing a Front Side using React.
